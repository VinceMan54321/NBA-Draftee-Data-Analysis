### Project Title: "Investigating NBA Draftee Priorities Over Time"

[Project](https://github.com/sta199-fa20-002/project-free-ducks) for STA 199 - Fall 2020

### Project Summary

Using a data set of NBA player statistics that spans from the 1996 to 2019 NBA seasons, we attempted to investigate how the priorities of what NBA teams look for in players during the draft process have changed over time. We wrangled our data to only include rookie seasons and to exclude the latest season (2019-20) since it was still ongoing at the time of data collection. Using both null simulations and two-sided t-tests, we tried to see if guards or frontcourt players were more preferred, whether that preference changed over time, and if defensive rebounding percentage, which was found to be associated with weight, changed during a specific time period (2000-2006). We determined that guards were more preferred throughout the entire timespan, but were unable to determine any conclusions about change in positional preference over time or defensive rebounding percentages in certain time periods.
